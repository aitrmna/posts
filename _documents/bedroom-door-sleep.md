## What Actually Happens

When you sleep in a closed room, you exhale CO₂ all night. In a small, sealed bedroom, levels can double or triple by morning. Typical numbers:

- Fresh outdoor air: ~400 ppm
- Bedroom with door/window open: ~700 ppm
- Bedroom sealed shut: ~1,100–1,500 ppm (sometimes higher)

## Does High CO₂ Hurt Your Sleep?

Research is mixed:

- **Above 1,000 ppm:** Some studies found reduced deep sleep, more time awake, higher morning stress hormones
- **Below 750 ppm:** Generally considered fine
- **The catch:** Several recent studies found opening the door lowered CO₂ but didn't improve sleep quality

Why the inconsistency? Noise, light, temperature, and personal differences matter too. Ventilation is one variable among many.

## What to Try

**Week 1:** Sleep with door cracked 10–15 cm. Note how you feel in the morning.

**Week 2:** Sleep with door fully closed. Compare.

That's it. Your body is the experiment.

## If You Can't Open the Door

- Crack a window in another room (creates airflow through gaps)
- Use a fan near the door gap
- Trickle vents if your windows have them

## If You're Curious About Numbers

A basic CO₂ monitor costs €30–50. You'll see exactly what happens overnight. Most people are surprised how fast levels climb in a closed room.

## Bottom Line

- Closed bedrooms do accumulate CO₂
- Whether that actually wrecks your sleep depends on the room, the person, and a dozen other factors
- Opening the door costs nothing — worth a test
- Don't expect miracles
