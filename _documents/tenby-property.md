Tenby is a medieval walled town on the Pembrokeshire coast. Harbour, three sandy beaches, pastel-coloured Georgian houses, Caldey Island a mile offshore. It's a proper place — not a resort that empties in winter. The old town is compact enough to walk everywhere, and the coastal path runs right through it.

We looked at every house for sale in Tenby on Rightmove — 69 properties — and filtered for max 3 bedrooms to find what's genuinely worth viewing. Almost everything is freehold. Nothing is SSTC, which tells you this market is slower than the English south coast.

## The Numbers

69 houses. Price range £140k to £1.7m. Median asking price £425k. Filter to 3 beds max and you get 30 properties, median £370k — after excluding three holiday lodges that aren't real houses.

Three agents dominate: Blackbear (the premium end, good descriptions, clearly the best local agent), FBM (volume, workmanlike), and John Francis (regional chain). Birt and Co handle some of the most interesting smaller properties.

## What We'd View

### The One Everyone Would Want

**[Seascape, £420k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/167326976)** — 3 bed detached in a quiet cul-de-sac with panoramic views towards Caldey Island and Giltar Point. Gas central heating, double glazing, driveway parking for two or three cars, low-maintenance landscaped garden. Walking distance to town, beaches and coastal path. Chain-free. This is the sweet spot: detached, views, parking, garden, sensible money. The views alone would sell it at this price in most coastal towns.

### Best Character

**[Heywood Lane, £435k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/155434367)** — Grade II listed semi-detached with what the agent calls "historic gothic charm." Three beds, two baths, parking and garden, walking distance to beach and harbour. Restored to a high standard while keeping the original features. The kind of house where you open the front door and immediately know whether it's for you or not.

**[Penally, £390k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/164888636)** — A character cottage on the edge of Tenby with an original bread oven fireplace, log burner, oak floors, arched windows. Country views from the bedrooms towards Tenby. En-suite master, garage, rear garden. This is the rural-but-close option — Penally is a five-minute drive or a pleasant walk along the lanes.

**[Greenhill Road, £320k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/168527201)** — An "upside-down house" set over three levels with the living space on top to maximise light. Vaulted ceiling, exposed beams, decked seating area. Three beds, two baths. Renovated in 2009, chain-free, short walk to beaches and harbour. The layout is unusual but that's what makes it — you get a bright, open living room where most terraces would give you a dark bedroom.

### Best Small Houses

**[Hawtree Cottage, £285k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/171210755)** — A recently refurbished 2-bed cottage on The Green. South-facing patio at the front, split-level garden enclosed by tall stone walls at the rear. Open-plan downstairs with a modern kitchen. Short walk to beaches and town. Residents' parking scheme. This is what £285k buys you in a walled town by the sea. Named cottages in Tenby don't come up often.

**[St Mary's Street, £275k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/162707438)** — "Trade Winds." A hidden gem tucked down a private alleyway, yards from the town centre and esplanade but completely private. Spiral staircase, sea views from upstairs, two beds plus study. Chain-free. The sort of property that has a name and a story. Lock-up-and-leave perfect.

### Best Views at the Top End

**[Coed Mor, Penally, £749k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/169453532)** — The best views in the dataset. Detached, modern, immaculate, overlooking Caldey Island. Three beds, three baths, office, snug, double garage, large garden with decking. If you want the Pembrokeshire dream house with nothing to do but move in, this is it.

**[Crackwell Street, £695k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/169772174)** — A four-storey townhouse with integrated garage overlooking Tenby harbour. Built in 2002, sea views from three levels, sash bay windows on the master and living room. Garage parking in the town centre is almost unheard of. This is the "live above the harbour" option.

**[Lady Park, £490k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/163585718)** — Detached with coastal views, large garden, garage and parking. Walk to beach, harbour and shops. Well presented, two reception rooms. The sensible detached-with-views choice below half a million.

### Best Project

**[South Parade, £140k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/171322799)** — Grade listed 3-bed terrace overlooking Tenby's ancient walls. Needs full renovation. Garden bordered by original Tenby stone walls. Selling by modern auction (56-day completion). The cheapest house in Tenby with genuine bones. If you know what you're doing and have cash, this is the one with the most upside.

### Best Versatile

**[Trefloyne Lane, Penally, £400k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/163456538)** — Detached, 3 beds, 3 reception rooms, annex potential, large gardens, rural views, and a 6-berth static caravan included. Not pretty, but a lot of space and flexibility for the money. If you need a workshop, office, or family annexe, the layout supports it.

## What's Missing

Only 6 of 69 listings include square footage, so we couldn't build a useful pricing model. Welsh agents are worse than English ones for publishing floor area. The EPC register has this data for most properties — we may backfill it later.

No property in the dataset is SSTC. Tenby moves slowly. Sellers should be open to offers.

Parking is genuinely scarce in the old town. Any property with off-street parking or a garage inside the walls has a structural advantage that the asking price rarely reflects fully.
