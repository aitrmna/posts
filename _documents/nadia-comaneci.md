On July 18, 1976, a 14-year-old Romanian girl did something so unprecedented that the technology literally couldn't process it.

Nadia Comăneci mounted the uneven bars at the Montreal Olympics. Ninety seconds later, the scoreboard flashed 1.00. The crowd went silent, confused. The judges started waving their arms.

The scoreboard hadn't malfunctioned—it simply wasn't built for what had just happened. Omega's display only went to 9.99. Nobody had programmed for perfection. The real score was 10.00, and they had to announce it over the PA while officials held up their fingers like they were bidding at an auction.

She didn't smile. Didn't cry. Barely reacted at all. Later, she'd explain she didn't understand the fuss—she'd hit that routine hundreds of times in the gym back in Onești. To her, this was just Tuesday.

It wasn't a fluke. Over the next few days, she scored seven perfect 10s across bars, beam, and floor. The Soviet gymnastics establishment, which had dominated the sport for decades, watched their empire crumble to a teenager who weighed 86 pounds.

The Soviets protested. Scores were challenged. It didn't matter. The image was already immortal: a child in a white leotard, expressionless, untouchable, rewriting what humans were supposed to be capable of.

Her coach was Béla Károlyi, a man who would later defect to America and shape US gymnastics for thirty years—though his legacy would eventually darken under accusations of brutal training methods and enabling abuse. Glory and damage often share the same roots.

Nadia herself defected in 1989, weeks before the Romanian revolution. She walked across the Hungarian border in the middle of the night, leaving behind everything except the weight of being perfect at fourteen.

Omega fixed their scoreboards before the next Olympics.

They never needed to use that fix again. Perfect 10s remained rare, mythical things—until the sport changed its scoring system entirely in 2006, abolishing the 10.0 scale altogether.

The perfect score now exists only in history. And history belongs to the girl who broke the machine.
