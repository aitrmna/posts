## The Big Picture

Remember how December looked like it was going to save us? Heavy rain, reservoirs filling up, Yorkshire lifted their hosepipe ban, everyone breathed a sigh of relief?

That's stopped.

The last two weeks of December and the first week of January were bone dry. England got 8% of normal rainfall for early January. Rivers that were running high in mid-December are now running low again. The recovery we saw in December has stalled.

Here's what's happening: we're getting a weather pattern where Atlantic storms are hitting the west and northwest (Cornwall, Wales, Lake District getting soaked), but the east and southeast are staying dry. So places like Cornwall have plenty of water, but Sussex, East Anglia, and the southeast are still struggling.

We have about 6–8 weeks left where rain can actually refill reservoirs and recharge groundwater. After mid-March, the ground warms up, plants start growing, and rainfall stops being effective at refilling our water sources.

## What This Means

If the next 6–8 weeks stay dry like the last two weeks, we're heading for serious water restrictions this summer. Not just hosepipe bans—potentially businesses being told they can't use water for non-essential purposes, maybe even worse measures in the most vulnerable areas.

If February brings proper Atlantic rain systems that hit the east (not just the west), we might be okay. But right now, the weather pattern isn't cooperating.

The frustrating thing is: the government's been quiet about this. After all the warnings in November and the relief in December, they're not being loud about the fact we're back in trouble. No major "save water now" campaigns, no urgent messaging. They're hoping February weather will sort it out.

## The Lincoln Situation

Good news first: Lincolnshire officially moved out of "prolonged dry weather" status and into "normal" status. That's better than places like East Anglia and Sussex that are still officially in drought.

But here's the reality: Lincoln sits right on the edge of the problem zone. East Anglia (your neighbours to the south and east) are in the worst shape in England right now. Their reservoirs are the lowest in the country, and farmers can't refill their irrigation reservoirs because river flows are too low—there are nearly 180 restrictions preventing farmers from taking water.

For actual tap water in Lincoln, there's no immediate danger. Anglian Water is at "drought level 1" which means they're watching things closely but no restrictions yet.

The bigger concern for the area is agriculture. If those irrigation reservoirs don't get refilled in the next few weeks, and we have a dry spring/summer, farmers in Lincolnshire and surrounding areas are going to struggle. That means potential food supply issues and definitely higher food prices.

## What To Expect

**Next few weeks:** Watch the weather. If we get proper rainy weeks in late January and February with systems coming from the Atlantic, we'll start to recover. If it stays cold and dry, we're in trouble.

**Spring (March–May):** If winter was dry, expect water companies to start talking about hosepipe bans again. East Anglia will likely see restrictions first, which could spread to Lincolnshire depending on how things go.

**Summer (June–August):** This is when we'll know if we're in crisis. If winter and spring were dry, expect widespread hosepipe bans by June, possibly stricter business restrictions by July–August in the worst-hit areas. East Anglia could potentially see emergency measures (standpipes, rotating supply cuts) if things get really bad, though that's not certain.

## What You Can Do

The best thing anyone can do right now is use less water. Shorter showers, don't leave taps running, hold off on power washing the driveway. Every litre saved now is a litre available in summer.

The government should be running major campaigns telling everyone this, but they're not. So it's on individuals to just do it anyway.

## The Bottom Line

We're not in crisis mode yet, but we're heading that way unless February weather rescues us. Lincoln's situation is better than East Anglia or Sussex, but close enough to the danger zone to warrant attention.

If mid-to-late January and February stay dry, start preparing for a restricted summer.
