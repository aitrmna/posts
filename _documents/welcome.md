This is a simple site for sharing documents with friends.

## Adding documents

Drop markdown files into the `_documents` folder with this front matter:

```yaml
---
title: Your Document Title
description: A brief summary (optional)
date: 2025-01-10
---
```

## Sharing

Each document gets its own clean URL you can share:
- `yoursite.github.io/document-name`

The home page lists everything chronologically.

## That's it

No comments, no tracking, no friction. Just readable documents.
