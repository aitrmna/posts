## The Core Reality

Sheep and goats are fundamentally different despite looking similar. Sheep are followers—flock-oriented, prefer flat pasture, eat grass down low. Goats are browsers—independent, climb everything, prefer weeds/brush/leaves at chest height. This shapes everything about how you manage them.

## What You Actually Need to Know

### Daily Non-Negotiables

- **Fresh water:** 4–15 litres per day depending on size and lactation status
- **Forage or hay:** Access throughout the day
- **Minerals:** Species-specific supplements (copper is critical for goats but toxic to sheep in high doses—never share minerals between species)
- **Visual health check:** Every single day

### The Health Check

Watch them move. A healthy animal rises rear-end first, walks without limping, has clear eyes, clean nose, and is eating/ruminating normally. Warning signs: isolation, lethargy, grinding teeth (pain signal), hunched posture.

### Fencing

Fencing is everything. Goats are escape artists and will test every weakness. You need 1.2–1.5 metre woven wire or electric net fencing. Sheep respect fences more but panic easily and can injure themselves running into inadequate barriers.

### Parasites

The number one killer of small ruminants. Learn the FAMACHA scoring system—checking inner eyelid colour to assess anaemia from barber pole worm. Deworm based on need, not schedule, to avoid resistance. Rotate pastures where possible.

### Hoof Trimming

Every 6–8 weeks. Overgrown hooves cause lameness and foot rot. Get proper shears and have someone demonstrate once—it's not difficult but technique matters.

## The Learning Curve

| Timeframe | Focus Areas |
|-----------|-------------|
| Months 1–3 | Daily observation, feeding routines, basic handling |
| Months 3–6 | Giving injections (Heptavac-P is the standard UK vaccine), hoof trimming, assessing body condition score |
| Months 6–12 | Recognising illness early, managing breeding cycles, handling basic emergencies |

## Practical Starting Point

Start with 3–4 animals (they need companions), not breeding stock. Wethers (castrated males) or dry ewes/does are lowest maintenance for learning.

## Essential Setup

- **Shelter:** Three-sided field shelter is sufficient; must be dry and draught-free
- **Fencing:** Stock fencing or electric netting, minimum 1.2m height for sheep, 1.5m for goats
- **Feeders:** Hay rack, trough for hard feed
- **Water:** Trough or automatic drinker, checked daily
- **First aid kit:** Iodine spray, hoof shears, thermometer, syringes, bloat drench
- **Vet relationship:** Establish one before you need emergency care

## UK-Specific Considerations

- **Holding number:** Required before you can keep livestock—apply through APHA (Animal and Plant Health Agency)
- **Flock/herd number:** Also required
- **Movement licences:** Needed for any animal movements; use eAML2 system
- **Ear tags:** Legally required identification
- **Medicine records:** Must be kept for all treatments
