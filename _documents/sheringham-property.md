Sheringham is a small coastal town in North Norfolk. Pretty, quiet, AONB. Good train link (Bittern Line to Norwich), independent shops, no chain-store blight. The kind of place people retire to or buy second homes in.

I looked at every house for sale in Sheringham on Rightmove — 62 properties — and built a pricing model to find what's undervalued. Here's what the market looks like.

## The Numbers

62 houses. Price range £190k to £875k. Median asking price £425k.

For context, Norfolk's county median is roughly £250–280k, so Sheringham carries a 50–60% coastal premium. You're paying for the sea, the AONB, and the fact that it hasn't been ruined yet.

| Type | Count | Median Price |
|------|------:|----------:|
| Detached | 26 | £540,000 |
| Mid-terrace | 10 | £440,000 |
| Semi-detached | 16 | £325,000 |
| End-terrace | 6 | £375,000 |
| Cottage | 2 | £270,000 |

Detached dominates supply. Semis are the value play — 40% cheaper than detached at median. The 3–4 bed bracket is the market's centre of gravity (40 of 62 listings).

## What's Actually Driving Price

I built a model that predicts what each property *should* cost based on its size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, property type, and parking. When a house is listed well below what the model predicts, it's likely underpriced. When it's listed well above, you're paying a premium for something the numbers don't capture — views, condition, or character.

The model explains about half of price differences from physical attributes. The other half is location-within-town, condition, views, and charm. What moves the needle most: size (by far), then whether it's detached (+£49k), number of bathrooms (+£36k each), and parking (+£20k). Every house in Sheringham is freehold and has a garden, so those don't matter here — they're table stakes.

## Beach Proximity Doesn't Pay

This surprised me. Properties within 500m of the beach have a *lower* median price (£400k) than those over 1km away (£500k). The gradient is inverted.

The explanation is straightforward: the close-to-beach stock is mostly smaller terraces and semis packed into the town centre. The expensive detached houses sit on the hillside to the south, further from the sea but with bigger plots and often better views. In Sheringham, the sea premium gets absorbed into property type rather than showing up as a clean distance effect.

## Supply

Arnolds Keys controls 47% of listings — the dominant local agent. Watsons and Pymm & Co split most of the rest. Sowerbys handles the premium end.

Supply is thin and seasonal. Only 2–5 new listings per month through most of 2025, then a burst of 21 in January 2026. Sellers timing for spring viewers. This is a market where you wait for what comes up rather than choosing from abundance.

## The Best Houses

After reading every listing description and cross-referencing the pricing model, these are the ones worth viewing.

### Best Overall

**[Priory Road, £425k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/172009349)** — 4 bed detached backing onto Beeston Common. Solar panels generating income. Gas central heating. Walking distance to beach and centre. "Would benefit from some updating" — code for cosmetic work only, which is why it's priced below what it should be. The model suggests this is worth closer to £536k. Clearest value in the dataset.

**[Nelson Road, £575k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/170741468)** — Early 1900s Arts & Crafts detached. Fully modernised: new kitchen, re-roofed 2024, upgraded garden room. 200ft rear garden with a wildlife pond and a converted beach hut. Planning permission already granted for kitchen and bedroom extensions. Close to the coastal path and Beeston Bump. The strongest property in the dataset. The only one where the owner clearly loved and invested in the place over decades. Chain-free.

**[Holway Road, £450k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/172051532)** — Victorian 5 bed over three floors. Modern kitchen with quartz worktops and bi-fold doors to garden, wood burner in the sitting room, two parking spaces off a rear driveway. Best blend of period character and modern finish at this price point. Model suggests it's worth around £542k.

**[Beeston Common, £440k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/166012598)** — 3 bed detached with open views over the common. Extended, character features, garage and ample parking. Quiet spot, walking distance to town. Chain-free. Model suggests around £497k.

### Best Value

**[Seaview Crescent, £500k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/159147794)** — The model's number one value pick. 4 bed 3 bath detached, high-spec new build with garage, walk-in wardrobe, three en-suites. Beach is 1.3km away — the new estate sits inland, which is why it's cheap for what it is. If proximity to the sea isn't the priority, this is the most house per pound.

**[Priory Road, £375k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/159963296)** — 3 bed detached, en-suite master, modern kitchen, enclosed garden, driveway. Clean, move-in ready. Good price for detached in Sheringham.

**[Holway Road, £375k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/169394735)** — 7 bed semi arranged as two self-contained units. Coastal views. Currently set up as home-with-income. Unusual property and not a traditional layout, but a lot of space for the money.

### Best Character

**[Augusta Street, £750k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/171842723)** — Victorian 1895, 5 bed, 147m from the beach. Self-contained top-floor flat for guests or income. Historic coach house and hayloft in the garden. One family for nearly 50 years. This is the house with soul.

**[Cromer Road, £735k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/161749490)** — Edwardian "Stella Maris". 5 bed 5 bath over three floors, fully refurbished retaining original character, south-facing garden, off-road parking. The most thorough renovation in the dataset.

**[The Boulevard, £750k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/160517603)** — Edwardian 7 bed 5 bath, flint and brick, first-floor balcony, 262m from the beach. Could work as a large family home or a guest house.

### Best for the Sea

**[The Driftway, £440k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/157477328)** — 113m from the beach. 4 bed 4 bath, off-road parking (rare this close to the water), chain-free.

**[Seacliff, £580k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/151706144)** — Bi-fold doors to a cliff terrace. Rooftop terrace with panoramic sea views. 5 bed, garage. The model flags it as overpriced — you're paying a hefty premium for the view. But what a view.

**[Sheringham (5 bed), £525k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/163731254)** — 43m from the beach. The closest to the sea in the entire dataset. Woodburner, en-suites, gardens.

### Best Projects

**[Sheringham, £240k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/165039533)** — 4 bed semi, short walk to beach. "Complete renovation project." Character features. Cash buyers only. The cheapest house with real potential.

**[Holt Road, £400k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/169656788)** — 4 bed detached with stunning sea views. Needs full cosmetic renovation but already has double glazing and gas central heating. Built into a natural bank — unusual setting.

**[Alexandra Road, £450k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/87589248)** — Edwardian 4/5 bed detached. South-facing garden. Roof overhauled in 2025. Needs updating but structurally sound. Chain-free, stone's throw from the town centre.
