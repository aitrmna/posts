Sheringham is a small coastal town in North Norfolk. Pretty, quiet, AONB. Good train link (Bittern Line to Norwich), independent shops, no chain-store blight. The kind of place people retire to or buy second homes in.

I looked at every house for sale in Sheringham on Rightmove — 62 properties — and built a pricing model to find what's undervalued. Here's what the market looks like.

## The Numbers

62 houses. Price range £190k to £875k. Median asking price £425k.

For context, Norfolk's county median is roughly £250–280k, so Sheringham carries a 50–60% coastal premium. You're paying for the sea, the AONB, and the fact that it hasn't been ruined yet.

| Type | Count | Median Price |
|------|------:|----------:|
| Detached | 26 | £540,000 |
| Mid-terrace | 10 | £440,000 |
| Semi-detached | 16 | £325,000 |
| End-terrace | 6 | £375,000 |
| Cottage | 2 | £270,000 |

Detached dominates supply. Semis are the value play — 40% cheaper than detached at median. The 3–4 bed bracket is the market's centre of gravity (40 of 62 listings).

## What's Actually Driving Price

I built a model that predicts what each property *should* cost based on its size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and property type. When a house is listed well below what the model predicts, it's likely underpriced. When it's listed well above, you're paying a premium for something the numbers don't capture — views, condition, or character.

The model explains about half of price differences from physical attributes. The other half is location-within-town, condition, views, and charm. What moves the needle most: size (by far), then whether it's detached (+£49k), then number of bathrooms (+£36k each). Every house in Sheringham is freehold and has a garden, so those don't differentiate — they're table stakes.

## Beach Proximity Doesn't Pay

This surprised me. Properties within 500m of the beach have a *lower* median price (£400k) than those over 1km away (£500k). The gradient is inverted.

The explanation is straightforward: the close-to-beach stock is mostly smaller terraces and semis packed into the town centre. The expensive detached houses sit on the hillside to the south, further from the sea but with bigger plots and often better views. In Sheringham, the sea premium gets absorbed into property type rather than showing up as a clean distance effect.

## Supply

Arnolds Keys controls 47% of listings — the dominant local agent. Watsons and Pymm & Co split most of the rest. Sowerbys handles the premium end.

Supply is thin and seasonal. Only 2–5 new listings per month through most of 2025, then a burst of 21 in January 2026. Sellers timing for spring viewers. This is a market where you wait for what comes up rather than choosing from abundance.

## The Best Houses

Filtered for up to 4 bedrooms, walking distance to town, and a garden. 44 of 62 qualify.

### Best Overall

**[Priory Road, £425k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/172009349)** — 4 bed detached backing onto Beeston Common. Solar panels generating income. Walking distance to beach and centre. "Would benefit from some updating" — code for cosmetic work only, which is why it's priced below what it should be. The model suggests this is worth closer to £536k. Clearest value in the dataset.

**[Nelson Road, £575k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/170741468)** — Early 1900s Arts & Crafts detached. Fully modernised: new kitchen, re-roofed 2024, upgraded garden room. 200ft rear garden with a wildlife pond and a converted beach hut. Planning permission already granted for kitchen and bedroom extensions. Close to the coastal path and Beeston Bump. The strongest property in the dataset. The only one where the owner clearly loved and invested in the place over decades. Chain-free.

**[Beeston Common, £440k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/166012598)** — 3 bed detached with open views over the common. Extended, character features, garage and ample gardens. Quiet spot, walking distance to town. Chain-free. Model suggests around £497k.

**[Abbey Close, £465k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/163371962)** — 4 bed detached chalet-style in a small private cul-de-sac. South-facing garden, double garage. Gas central heating. Needs some updating. Model suggests around £538k. Chain-free.

### Best Value

**[Priory Road, £375k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/159963296)** — 3 bed detached, en-suite master, modern kitchen, enclosed garden, driveway. Clean, move-in ready. Hard to find detached in Sheringham at this price.

**[Cromer Road, £375k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/170741495)** — 4 bed end-terrace in brick and flint, overlooking Beeston Common. Contemporary interior styling, dual-aspect sitting room, modern kitchen with integrated appliances and stable door to garden. Model suggests around £434k. Chain-free.

**[Seaview Crescent, £500k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/159147794)** — The model's number one value pick. 4 bed 3 bath detached, high-spec new build with walk-in wardrobe and three en-suites. Beach is 1.3km away — the new estate sits inland, which is why it's cheap for what it is. If proximity to the sea isn't the priority, this is the most house per pound.

### Best Character

**[Angel Yard, £270k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/163814228)** — 3 bed flint and brick cottage, tucked away near the beach and shops. Full of charm and deceptively spacious. Gas central heating. Chain-free. A proper Norfolk cottage.

**[The Driftway, £440k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/157477328)** — 4 bed 4 bath, 113m from the beach. Imposing and highly individual, with off-road parking in a location where that's rare. Recently refurbished. Chain-free.

**[Alexandra Road, £450k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/87589248)** — Edwardian 4 bed detached. South-facing garden. Roof overhauled in 2025. Beautifully proportioned, full of character, needs updating but structurally sound. Chain-free, stone's throw from the town centre.

### Best for the Sea

**[High Street, £265k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/160625552)** — 2 bed flint and brick cottage, 128m from the beach, right in the heart of town. Private garden, sealed unit glazing, modern electric heating. Charming, and the cheapest route to living by the sea. Chain-free.

**[Vincent Road, £415k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/151867715)** — 3 bed detached, 381m from the beach, with superb sea views from the rear. Currently a holiday let but equally suitable as a permanent home. Individual design and character. Chain-free.

### Best Projects

**[Sheringham, £240k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/165039533)** — 4 bed semi, short walk to town and beach. "Complete renovation project." Character features. Cash buyers only. The cheapest house with real potential.

**[Holt Road, £400k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/169656788)** — 4 bed detached with stunning sea views. Needs full cosmetic renovation but already has double glazing and gas central heating. Built into a natural bank — unusual setting.
