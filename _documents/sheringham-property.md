Sheringham is a small coastal town in North Norfolk. Pretty, quiet, AONB. Good train link (Bittern Line to Norwich), independent shops, no chain-store blight. The kind of place people retire to or buy second homes in.

We looked at every house for sale in Sheringham on Rightmove — 62 properties — and built a pricing model to find what's undervalued. Here's what the market looks like, filtered for max 3 bedrooms.

## The Numbers

62 houses total. Filter to 3 beds max and you get 24 properties: price range £190k to £540k, median £325k. Eight detached, eight semi-detached, the rest terraces and cottages. Everything is freehold. Nothing is SSTC — this market moves slowly.

Arnolds Keys controls nearly half of all listings and handles the best stock. Watsons and William H. Brown split most of the rest. Pymm & Co picks up the value end.

We built a model that predicts what each property should cost based on size, bedrooms, bathrooms and type. When a house is listed well below what the model predicts, it's likely underpriced. The model explains about half of price variation — the rest is location-within-town, condition, views and charm. Only 12 of 24 small properties have published square footage, so value scores are partial.

## What We'd View

### Best Overall

**[Priory Road, £375k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/159963296)** — 3 bed detached with en-suite master, modern fitted kitchen, two reception rooms, enclosed rear garden and driveway. Close to shops, cafes and the station. The model's highest value score in this bracket (VP 89.5) — it thinks this should be closer to £400k+. Clean, move-in ready, nothing to do. The boring-but-right choice.

**[Beeston Common, £440k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/166012598)** — 3 bed detached with open views over the common. Extended at rear, character features throughout, gas central heating, new garage, ample parking. Walking distance to town and beach. Chain-free. The setting is what sells it — Beeston Common is the best address in Sheringham that isn't seafront.

**[Beech Avenue, £318k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/162527627)** — Described as "truly deceptive" — 3 bed semi with three reception rooms, south-facing garden, garage and off-road parking. 1,312 sqft for £318k is strong. Close to schools and Pretty Corner woods. VP 76.3. If you need space on a budget, this is the answer.

### Best Character

**[Angel Yard, £270k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/163814228)** — 3 bed flint and brick cottage, tucked away near the beach and shops. Full of charm and deceptively spacious at 990 sqft. Gas central heating. Chain-free. A proper Norfolk cottage — the agent says a private viewing is the only way to appreciate it, and they're probably right.

**[Augusta Street, £299k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/162062939)** — A "chocolate box cottage" with two bedrooms, open fire, two reception rooms and an enclosed garden. Untouched and in need of updating, which is precisely why it's interesting. 868 sqft of potential in the west end of town. The sort of place that could be transformed for £40–50k and be worth significantly more.

**[Angel Yard, £250k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/156254141)** — 1 bed cottage. Oak flooring, claw-foot bath, granite kitchen worktops. The perfect lock-up-and-leave. Chain-free. If you want a bolthole in Sheringham for the lowest possible price without compromising on charm, this is it.

### Best for the Sea

**[Vincent Road, £415k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/151867715)** — 3 bed detached with superb sea views from the rear. Individual design, conservatory overlooking the garden, gas central heating. Currently a holiday let but equally suitable as a permanent home. Chain-free. The sea views are the real asset — you don't get those at this price in most Norfolk coastal towns.

**[High Street, £265k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/160625552)** — 2 bed flint and brick cottage right in the heart of town, a stone's throw from the beach. Private garden, sealed unit glazing, modern electric heating. Full of clues to its history. Chain-free. The cheapest route to living by the sea in Sheringham.

**[New Road, £395k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/170729933)** — 3 bed mid-terrace, recently refurbished throughout, arranged over three floors. South-facing garden, gas central heating, en-suite shower room. Short walk from beach and shops. Chain-free. Beautifully presented — this is what a proper town house refurbishment looks like.

### Best Project

**[Woodhouse Close, £260k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/168091367)** — 3 bed detached. "Requires updating" — agent code for it needs everything. But: garage, off-road parking, enclosed rear garden, gas central heating already in. £260k for a detached house in Sheringham is rare. Cash buyers or investors who know what renovation costs.

### The Big House

**[De Morley Garth, £540k](https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/166288331)** — 3 bed detached, 2,109 sqft — nearly double the size of most 3-beds in this dataset. Extended chalet-style, two reception rooms, conservatory, two bathrooms, good-sized plot with ample parking. VP 84.2 — the model thinks this is strong value for the space. Chain-free. If you want the most house per pound in Sheringham with only three bedrooms, this is unmatched.

## What's Missing

The beach premium is inverted here. Properties within 500m of the beach have a lower median price than those further south. The explanation: close-to-beach stock is mostly smaller terraces, while the expensive detached houses sit on higher ground with bigger plots. In Sheringham, the sea premium gets absorbed into property type rather than showing up as a clean distance effect.

Supply is thin. Only 2–5 new listings per month through most of 2025, then a burst in January 2026. Sellers timing for spring viewers. This is a market where you wait for what comes up rather than choosing from abundance.

Chain-free dominates — 18 of 24 properties mention no onward chain. Second-home territory.
