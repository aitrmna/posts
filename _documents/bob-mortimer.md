## The Origin Story: Chaos From Day One

Bob Mortimer was born in Middlesbrough in 1959, and almost immediately began his career of causing lovable mayhem. When he was seven years old, two things happened in quick succession that set the tone for his entire existence:

1. His father died tragically in a car crash
2. Bob accidentally **burned down the family home with a firework**

Not a firework outside. Inside. He wanted to see if he could light a sparkler indoors. A "cascade of sparks" fell into an open box of fireworks. His mother, surveying the smoldering ruins of their home, reportedly called it "probably a blessing."

This is your protagonist.

## The Sniper's Dream & Theft and Shrubbery

As a teenager in Middlesbrough, Bob ran with a gang of lads with names so perfectly Bob Mortimer that you'd assume he made them up: **Stavva, Bagga, Neil Overall**, and the legendary **Gary "Cheesy" Cheeseman** — who had a very big head.

"A sniper's dream, we used to call him."

Their game of choice? **Theft and Shrubbery**. The rules were simple:

1. Sneak into someone's back garden at night
2. Find a window where a family is watching telly with curtains open
3. Slowly walk toward the window, chanting increasingly louder: *"We do beg your pardon, we are in your garden"*
4. Wait for someone to scream, then leg it through the shrubbery

When asked what was stolen, Bob clarified: "We just always felt we were stealing something from them."

Another game involved throwing fruit straight up in the air and letting it land on your own head. Middlesbrough in the 1970s, ladies and gentlemen.

## The Cockroach King

Before comedy, Bob trained as a solicitor, specializing in welfare law. Working in Peckham, he became an expert in **Public Health Act cases involving cockroach infestations in council properties**. He was so successful that the South London Press dubbed him **"The Cockroach King."**

During this time, he was once mugged by one of his own clients. The client stopped mid-mugging, recognized Bob, apologized, and left. **Bob continued to represent him.**

His punk band during this era was called **Dog Dirt.**

## The Dentist of Nightmares

One of Bob's most legendary revelations on *Would I Lie to You?* was that **he has performed his own dentistry for over fifteen years.**

His toolkit:
- **Fuji 9 dental cement** (professional grade, somehow acquired)
- Superglue (for emergencies before TV appearances)
- A mirror
- The sheer confidence of a man unburdened by fear

He explained the process with unsettling calm: mix the cement, pack it in, wait for it to set. He's done crowns. He's done fillings. He's fixed things that have fallen out on live television.

When Stacey Solomon asked incredulously how he even got Fuji 9, Bob simply said you can buy it. When asked if a dentist had ever noticed his handiwork, he replied that they had, and they'd said it was "surprisingly good."

He once lost multiple teeth while biting a Kit Kat Chunky on *Sunday Brunch*. Rather than treating this as a crisis, he stored the incident as future WILTY material and carried on with his life.

Professional dentists reading this are currently weeping into their sterilization equipment.

## 17 Sugars (But Not 18)

A direct quote:

> "At one point I was putting 17 sugars in my tea. I know it's unbelievable and I do wonder sometimes what my mum was thinking to allow it. The weirdest thing was that if I had 18 teaspoons it was too sweet."

The mathematical precision of this madness is genuinely beautiful.

## Chris Rea Popped an Egg in His Bath

In 1997, Bob was helping record a song with Middlesbrough FC and singer Chris Rea. After the session, he went to Chris Rea's house.

Chris Rea told him to have a bath. Then leaned in and said:

**"I've popped an egg in there for you."**

When asked on *Would I Lie to You?* what the thinking was behind it, Bob replied: "I've never found out. All I know is I woke up the next day and I have never felt so alive."

He also mentioned Chris Rea had sent him a gold doily.

As David Mitchell spiraled trying to determine the truth, Bob pleaded with genuine desperation: **"Please don't base your decision on the albumen whitening."**

*This was a lie on the show.* But the fact that David Mitchell genuinely couldn't tell — and that "please don't base your decision on the albumen whitening" is now a sentence that exists in the universe — is testament to the Mortimer reality distortion field.

## The Reversible Toilet & Christian Slater

Bob designed a backwards toilet — one you sit on facing the wall, so you can read a book or use a laptop resting on the cistern.

He then **pitched this invention to the actor Christian Slater.**

Christian Slater invested actual money.

This was **true.**

## The Cat Names

Bob Mortimer sells cat names on Twitter for £8 per annum. Here are some actual examples he has proposed:

**The Classics:**
- Gary Cheeseman (wait, that was his real friend)
- Sergeant Walnuts
- Crackers McKnackers
- Fond Margaret

**The Foods:**
- Fish and Tits
- Sausage and Tits
- Mainly Sausages
- Quality Parsnips
- 7 Hamburgers

**The Corporate:**
- Mr. Several Businesses
- Gary from Admin
- Steve Briefcase
- Threat Level Tesco
- Aldi Best
- Lidl Wayne

**The Incomprehensible:**
- Craig's Anus
- Mary Berry's Crack Den
- Django Untrained
- BBC's The Office
- Let It Go From Frozen
- 6 Miles to Debenhams
- Floating Tiger Hidden Moorhen
- Paul Blart Falafel Cop
- The Many Chins of Derek O
- Rt. Hon. Nutty Shite
- Russ Abbot's Cape
- Dean Gaffney's Cauldron

There are literally **hundreds more.** His current cat is called **Goodmonson.**

## The Apple Whisperer

Bob can **break an apple clean in half with his bare hands.**

This is not a metaphor. This is not a joke. He demonstrated it on *Would I Lie to You?* and again on *Taskmaster*. It uses friction and thumb pressure on the small raised bumps at the top.

Countless fans have since tried to replicate it. Some have succeeded. Most have just bruised their palms while a Granny Smith bounced off the floor.

## The Heart, The Ox, and Damien Hirst

In 2015, Bob needed emergency triple bypass surgery. His career nearly ended. His life nearly ended.

His friend, artist **Damien Hirst**, responded by:
1. Getting an ox's heart
2. Running a silver arrow through it
3. Preserving it in formaldehyde
4. Giving it to Bob as a gift

This is simultaneously the most metal and most touching thing anyone has ever done for a friend.

The surgery succeeded. Bob used his recovery time to start *Gone Fishing* with Paul Whitehouse — who'd also had heart surgery. Two men who'd nearly died, sitting by rivers, talking about life, death, and fish. Bob describes Paul as looking like **"a walnut on a stick."** Paul presumably has equally affectionate descriptions of Bob.

## Train Guy & Athletico Mince

Bob's podcast with Andy Dawson, *Athletico Mince*, was supposed to be about football. By episode 20, it had completely derailed into something far more unhinged.

**Train Guy / Barry Homeowner** is Bob's masterpiece character — a pompous business commuter on video calls to his colleague "Col," spouting gibberish corporate speak that somehow perfectly captures every insufferable person you've ever shared a train carriage with:

> "Ya, ya. Hi, hi Colin, yeah yeah. Off to London, head office. Yeah London! Yeah, city of success, yeah."

> "You have a good Crimbo-mas? Booze-a-thon-a-ding-dong, I bet."

> "They say the lifts there are so swift that your tits kiss you on the way up."

The clips go viral every time he posts one.

**Peter Beardsley** is reimagined as a deeply melancholic figure who tells terrible jokes in a mournful Geordie accent. **Scottish Tales** are haunting folk songs about young men trapped on remote Scottish islands, yearning to escape the tyrannical laird and flee to the mainland — drawn by the promise of Timpson's shoe repair, key cutting machines, and Costa Coffee shops with free WiFi.

One critic described it as "the joy of a beautiful mind, just chucking stuff away on a podcast."

## The Jarvis Cocker Legal Consultation

In 1996, at the Brit Awards, Jarvis Cocker famously invaded the stage during Michael Jackson's performance, wiggling his bum in protest at what he saw as Jackson's messianic presentation.

Backstage chaos ensued. Jarvis needed legal advice.

**Bob Mortimer — still a qualified solicitor — was there.**

He provided impromptu legal counsel to Jarvis Cocker in the aftermath of the most infamous stage invasion in Brit Awards history. This actually happened. Bob was at the Brits, Jarvis needed a lawyer, Bob was technically a lawyer.

The image of Bob Mortimer dispensing legal wisdom to a panicking Jarvis Cocker while Michael Jackson's people swarmed backstage is, frankly, cinema.

## The Castle Douglas Incident

As a teenager, Bob and friends — including **Harry Harryman** and **Steve Bytheway** (names so perfect they must be real) — drove a Morris Minor to Scotland to "get as close to the Gulf Stream as possible."

They slept in the car wearing **latex old man masks** and "jobbletops" to keep warm. Crucially, they continued wearing the grotesque masks during the day.

They parked up to get Scotch pies. A sergeant appeared.

They were taken to the local police station. A plain clothes detective entered the room, looked at them, and asked only: **"What's with the funny faces?"**

They were then followed to the city limits and watched until they left.

*This was true.* Bob still seemed mildly confused about why this was considered unusual behavior.

## The Closing Argument

Here is a man who:
- Burned down his childhood home at age 7
- Was crowned the Cockroach King
- Was mugged by his own client (and kept representing him)
- Put 17 sugars in his tea (but not 18, that's too sweet)
- Performed dentistry on himself with professional cement for 15 years
- Invented a backwards toilet and got Christian Slater to invest
- Was escorted out of a Scottish town by police for wearing latex old man masks
- Can snap an apple in half with his bare hands
- Has named cats things like "Craig's Anus," "Threat Level Tesco," and "6 Miles to Debenhams"
- Received an ox heart pierced with a silver arrow from Damien Hirst

And every single one of these things is true. That's the bit that breaks people.

When Bob Mortimer appears on *Would I Lie to You?*, his name trends on Twitter hours before broadcast. David Mitchell has described the experience of trying to determine Bob's truths from lies as something approaching genuine psychological torment. The stories are too absurd to be real. They are almost always real.

Bob was cripplingly shy until his 30s. He didn't speak up. He didn't tell his stories. Then Vic Reeves happened, and now we have Train Guy, and the Scottish Tales, and Theft and Shrubbery, and a comprehensive database of purchasable cat names.

The quiet ones, it turns out, were just waiting.

*"It can be very lonely knowing that you've got things to say, but you daren't say them."*

He said them. About the teeth and the eggs and Gary Cheeseman's massive sniper's-dream head.

And somewhere, right now, he's probably buying Fuji 9 in bulk.
